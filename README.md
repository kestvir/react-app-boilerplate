# Vinted-Homework-Assignment

## Features

- Added all of the features specified in the requirements.
- Added two specified bonus features: lazy-loading images and responsive images.
- Added three more bonus features: blur effect on image load, scroll to top button and a spinner to indicate image fetch loading.

## Development process and thoughts

Decided to test the application mainly using e2e tests instead of unit and integration, because after some research I came to a conclusion that scrolling related behavior can be tested best with e2e tests. However, still wanted to show that I understand concepts of component unit testing, thefore, added the test for `<ToggleImagesViewButton />`
